Scar: 	Life's not fair, is it? You see I -- well, I... shall never be King. {exhale lightly} And you... shall never see the light of another day. {closed-mouth laughter. Starts to place the mouse on his extended tongue} ... Adieu... {quiet laugh}
Zazu: 	{Interrupting} Didn't your mother ever tell you not to play with your food?
Scar: 	{Light sigh. The mouse is under his paw.} What do you want?
Zazu: 	I'm here to announce that King Mufasa is on his way. {bows} ...So you'd better have a good excuse for missing the ceremony this morning.
